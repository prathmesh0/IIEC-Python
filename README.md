 you can open any apps you want and you can add your own apps to its very easy... 
 I used list for opening apps, not individual sentence for opening an individual app  so there can be as many as apps you want 
 adding apps instruction will be written there when you will run it.


where you will save file there will be directory working means you can do multiples actions on the files present in the directory where your file is saved.


first download miniconda(https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) or anaconda(https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) and Python(https://www.python.org/downloads/) 

if some errors occurs make sure you have installed all modules. cmd lines given bellow of each module to install it

python program made special for Mac OS there are lots of apps to open for Mac OS with just simple conversation as we do normally and even create, rename,open,view,delete files. may be some function will not work in windows, but this program is also optimised for Windows ,  because I don't have windows and I didn't tested in windows. but aps will open in windows.
